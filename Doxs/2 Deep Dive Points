## 📝 Original User Prompt

> Ok listen, I have saved all what you have given till now. This real estate - this is more attended thing for more love and more likes, and I can keep my entire days for these real estate, inspiring by these billionaires, millionaires, in Los Angeles and the top states and cities in Europe and such, also these from Dubai. Such, I am more interested and feeling to make this a big and more and a well organised one - ok, part of life. I am willing to keep in real estate, so do deep dive. I have activated the deep thinking and also after finding more and deeper, make a special integration what all the present are not using in the AI and app and the technology and new ideas. And such, also go to our Puranas like ideas or concepts of lands and some loops or techniques so I can use those - for not our Sanatana Dharma, our will be a 100% Dharma so they won't do any gimmicks or find loops. So go to some other ancient civilizations also, so they always do some other hack or Adharma or some unethical. Also such, also with right things, so check all and give new ideas and new integrations, so I will be unanimous in this field for the starting phase and entrance - so many will see only me as the only option for this. Ok, I think you understand all the different thoughts. Don't just focus on one idea, make points of all ideas and go clean and brief for all.
