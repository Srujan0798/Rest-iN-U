# 📚 DEV VAULT
## The "Unwritten Rules" of Software Engineering

> **FOR AI AGENTS:**
> This folder contains high-density, production-grade knowledge.
> **Rule #1**: Do not summarize. Read deeply.
> **Rule #2**: Prioritize "War Stories" and "Failures" over generic definitions.
> **Rule #3**: Understand the *intent* behind the code, not just the syntax.

### 🚀 Quick Start
Go to **[00_MASTER_INDEX.md](./00_MASTER_INDEX.md)** for the full map.

### 💎 The Philosophy
We believe that real seniority comes from seeing things fail.
This vault is a collection of those failures, so you don't have to repeat them.

- **Real Code**: No "foo bar" examples. Real logic.
- **Real Scale**: Problems that only happen at 1M+ users.
- **Real Money**: Bugs that have financial consequences.

### 📂 Structure
- **01-09**: Core Engineering (The "Hard" Skills)
- **10-15**: Specialized Domains (The "Unique" Value)
- **16-20**: Advanced Features (The "Premium" Value)
