Now I'll continue by creating the remaining essential infrastructure: state management, CI/CD pipeline, and documentation.I've completed a comprehensive set of infrastructure components for REST-iN-U. Here's what was built:
State Management (Zustand Stores)
1. Auth Store (/src/store/auth-store.ts)
User authentication state (user, tokens, loading, error)
Login/logout/refresh session actions
Role & permission checks (hasRole, hasPermission, isAgent, isAdmin)
Persistent storage with localStorage
2. Property Store (/src/store/property-store.ts)
Favorites management (add, remove, toggle, clear)
Compare list (max 4 items with validation)
Recently viewed properties (max 20 with deduplication)
Search filters with active filter tracking
Saved searches with alert toggles
View mode (grid/list/map) and map state
3. UI Store (/src/store/ui-store.ts)
Sidebar & mobile menu state
Modal stack management
Toast notifications with convenience methods
Confirm dialog state
Global loading indicator
Search overlay state
Scroll locking for modals
4. Notification Store (/src/store/notification-store.ts)
Real-time notifications with unread count
Mark as read (single, multiple, all)
Notification preferences (email, push, SMS, in-app)
Connection state tracking
Helper functions for icons, colors, labels
CI/CD & GitHub Configuration
1. GitHub Actions Workflows
ci-cd.yml: Full pipeline with lint, test, build, deploy to staging/production
pr.yml: PR validation, preview deployments, bundle size checks
2. Issue & PR Templates
Bug report template
Feature request template
Pull request template
3. Automation
labeler.yml: Auto-label PRs based on file changes
dependabot.yml: Automated dependency updates
Middleware & Security
Next.js Middleware (/src/middleware.ts)
Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
Authentication route protection
Role-based access control
Locale detection
Feature flag headers
Documentation
README.md: Project overview, setup, tech stack, scripts
CONTRIBUTING.md: Contribution guidelines, style guide, workflow
SECURITY.md: Security policy, vulnerability reporting
LICENSE: MIT License
lighthouserc.json: Performance audit configuration
Unit Tests
Auth store tests (__tests__/store/auth-store.test.ts)
Property store tests (__tests__/store/property-store.test.ts)
Updated Dependencies
Added immer for Zustand middleware
Added test:ci and preview scripts to package.json
The frontend is now feature-complete with all major components: pages, UI components, services, integrations, state management, middleware, and CI/CD pipelines!
